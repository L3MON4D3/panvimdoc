# panvimdoc

Write documentation in [pandoc markdown](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html).
Generate documentation in vimdoc.

# Motivation

Writing documentation is hard.
Writing documentation for vim plugins is an additional hassle.
Making writing vim plugin documentation frictionless can be useful.

Writing documentation in markdown and converting it to vimdoc can help toward that goal.
This way, plugin authors will have to write documentation just once as part of the README of the project, and have the vim documentation autogenerated.

Writing vim documentation requires conforming to a few simple rules.
Although `vimdoc` is not a well defined spec, it does have some nice syntax highlighting and features like tags and links when a text file is in `vimdoc` compatible format and when the `filetype=help` in vim.
Also, typically, while vim documentation is just plain text files, they are usually formatted well using whitespace.
Preserving these features and characteristics is important.

See [References](#references) for more information.

It would be nice to write documentation in Markdown and convert to vimdoc.
[@mjlbach](https://github.com/mjlbach) has already implemented a neovim treesitter markdown to vimdoc converter that works fairly well.
I found two other projects that do something similar, again linked in the references.
As far as I can tell, these projects are all in use and actively maintained and these projects may suit your need.

However, none of these projects use Pandoc.
Pandoc Markdown supports a wide number of features.
Firstly, it supports a range of Markdown formats and flavors.
Secondly, Pandoc has lua filters and a custom output writer that can be configured in lua.

This project aims to write a specification in Pandoc Markdown, and take advantage of Pandoc filters, to convert a Markdown file to a vim documentation help file.

# Goals of this project:

- Markdown file must be readable when the file is presented as the README on GitHub / GitLab.
- Markdown file converted to HTML using Pandoc must be web friendly and render appropriately (if the user chooses to do so).
- Vim documentation generated must support links and tags.
- Vim documentation generated should be aesthetically pleasing to view, in vim and as a plain text file.
  - This means using column and spacing appropriately.
- Use built in Vim documentation as guidelines but not rules.

# Features

- Autogenerate title for vim documentation
- Generate links and tags
- Support markdown syntax for tables
- Support raw vimdoc syntax where ever needed for manual control.

# Specification

The specification is described in [panvimdoc.md](./doc/panvimdoc.md) along with examples.
The generated output is in [panvimdoc.txt](./doc/panvimdoc.txt).
The reference implementation of the Pandoc lua filter is in [panvimdoc.lua](./scripts/panvimdoc.lua).
